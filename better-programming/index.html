    <p>Many have learned programming to the point where they understand <code>if</code> and <code>for</code>
and function calls, and can make the computer do what they want. Few know how to
structure code so that it is easy to work with, over time and at large scale.
How can you learn to structure code well? For a start, I suggest a book, an
essay, a collection of functions and a talk, in this order.</p><h2 id="grok-simplicity">Grok simplicity</h2><p><a href="https://grokkingsimplicity.com/">Grokking Simplicity by Eric Normand</a> teaches
all the things I wish every programmer knew, but few do (at least judging from
all the code I've seen so far). Other sources, such as <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/">The Pragmatic
Programmer</a>,
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring</a> or TDD try to
teach these, too, but they don't hit the heart of the matter. Instead they focus
on lagging metrics like ‘easy to change’, heuristics like function length and
proxies like testability. Grokking Simplicity hits the heart of the matter.</p><p>It is almost 600 pages long, but those are not the heavy pages of Skiena's
<a href="https://www.algorist.com/">Algorithm Design Manual</a>. Rather, they are light
pages with many pictures and repeated examples. And the more advanced you are,
the faster you can move. It's not the kind of book where you skip one exercise
and lose track.</p><p>Finally, you can start applying what you learn from this book in any existing
codebase. No rewrite from scratch required. If you start wondering how, as you
make your way into the book, I suggest reading the last chapter. It will tell
you.</p><h2 id="learn-to-grow-a-language">Learn to grow a language</h2><p>Growing a language is a skill that I consider very important and which is taught
in Grokking Simplicity. But in my experience, two or three more things are
required to make it stick: Read <a href="http://paulgraham.com/progbot.html">Programming Bottom-Up by Paul
Graham</a> and, to see many concrete examples,
explore the <a href="https://clojure.org/api/cheatsheet">Clojure standard library</a>. If
you have time, watch or read enough of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0">Growing a Language by Guy Steele
(YouTube)</a> to get the point. (If
you have even more time, I recommend you watch or read it all.) I'm lazy to
argue why these are the things to read/explore/watch. They are short enough to
speak for themselves, I hope. But I'll leave you with a thought from Growing a
Language, which might otherwise be overlooked:</p><blockquote><p>I had to take time to think through how to phrase each thought. And there was
this choice for each new word: is it worth the work to define it, or should I
just stick with the words I have? Should I do the work of defining a new word
such as mirror, or should I just say “looking glass” each time I want to speak
of one? (As an example, I was tempted more than once to state the “ly” rule
for making new words that change what verbs mean, but in the end I chose to
cast all such words to one side and make do. And I came that close to defining
the word without, but each time, for better or for worse, I found some other
way to phrase my thought.)</p><p>I learned in my youth […] that it is better to choose short words when I can.
[…] I should try to make my thoughts clear; if they are clear and right, then
other persons can judge my work as it ought to be judged.</p><p>[…] Short words work well, if I choose them well.</p></blockquote><h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><ul><li>Growing a Language is also available on the Archive:

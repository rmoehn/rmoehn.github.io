    <title>Little Pluses: Why?</title>
    

<meta name="description" content="Why little pluses? Because this applies to daily life, too:Making Progress and Improving a Military OrganizationIt is the aim of everyone who is privileged to command a company, battalion,
brigade, or division to leave it in much better shape than he found it and to be
sure his superiors recognize that fact.The “Little Pluses” MethodHow is the best way to accomplish this objective? I have seen it tried in
more ways than one, but the most effective way is to improve gradually every
facet of the organization over a period of time by what I call a system of
“little pluses.” By that I mean making positive improvements starting in one or
more fields which are each not extensive or radical enough to upset the
functioning of the unit team or to cause an undue amount of turbulence. If this
is done, over a period of a few weeks or months, the net result will be a great
step forward, a substantial “tightening up“ of the organization, a constant
feeling of accomplishment in the whole unit, and the violent swings of the
pendulum will be avoided. These latter come from too large or radical steps and
are disruptions of the smooth working of the organization.The “little pluses” method also, if spread over all the activities of the
organization, will enable a commander to make his unit excellent or better in
all things and as a result will enable it to attain the accepted status of a
superior unit.The “little pluses” method may not provide the basis of unit paper or Stars
and Stripes headlines or feature stories, but it will soon be recognized by your
next higher commander and your unit will gain the general reputation of being a
“solid“ outfit. Your efficiency report will make good reading to you and to the
members of promotion boards.">
